# Graph coloring
Genetic algorithm implemented in C++ language used to solve an NP-hard problem of graph vertex coloring. This algorithm speeds up functioning of NP-hard problem by testing and improving multiple variances and then choosing the best one.

You can also find there an implementation of:
- graph generator 
- brute force algorithm

### How to compile?
Go to directory with project and in command line type:
```
g++ -o main.exe main.cpp genetic_algorythm.cpp helper_functions.cpp
```
Then run created `main.exe` file typing its name in command line.

### Usage
To compare results of the algorithm we used a couple of benchmark instances which are placed in _benchmark_ and _instances_ catalogue.
